# subdomain-enumeration
A Python-based subdomain enumeration tool that collects subdomains from multiple OSINT and threat‑intelligence sources like crt.sh, AlienVault OTX, VirusTotal, SecurityTrails, TLS BufferOver, and ThreatCrowd. It aggregates, cleans, deduplicates, and displays results to help security researchers map a domain’s attack surface.
